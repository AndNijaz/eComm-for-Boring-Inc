[Repository Link](https://github.com/AndNijaz/eComm-for-Boring-Inc)

## Project Description
The eComm for Boring Inc project calculates profit margins for orders processed through an eCommerce platform. This application analyzes order data provided in CSV format and generates key financial reports such as total revenue, total profit, profit per shirt size, and more. The solution uses multithreading to enhance performance and implements the Strategy pattern for payment processing.
